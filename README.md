# Anomoly Detection w/ XGBoost

This project demonstrates how XGBoost classification can be used for anomoly detection. Methods also used: Bayesian optimization for hyperparmeter search.

Project details:

- Using the 'import entry' dataset, predict import refusals in human food supply chain.
- The target variable is named “final disposition”. Only values with the words ‘refusal’ and ‘recon’ (reconditioned – essentially another type of refusal) are considered the outcomes of interest.

- Data is from the FDA compliance dashboards (Imports Entry) located at: https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/index.htm
